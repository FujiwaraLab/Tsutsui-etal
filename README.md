7th January 2021. 

These R codes were used in the paper Tsutsui et al., (link). 
The codes were written by Hiroki Machida and Ko Tsutsui, with support from Kyungmin Ahn. 

## Description

These R codes were used to examine gene expression of mouse skin cells.
For scRNA-seq analysis, gene expression patterns of epithelial cell populations in scRNA-seq data of Ge et al. were examined with the code "210107_Supplementary_Fig10.R". The first half of this code was wrote by referring the original code deposited by Ge et al. in GitHub (https://github.com/nyuhuyang/scRNAseq-MouseSkinEpithelia) to reproduce the results in the original paper. The latter half was written to further examine ECM gene expression patterns in young and old epithelial sub-populations.
