This R code was used in the paper Tsutsui et al., (link). 
The code was written by Hiroki Machida with support from Kyungmin Ahn. 

## Description

This R code was used to examine ECM gene expression patterns of epithelial cell populations in scRNA-seq data of Ge et al. The first half of this code was wrote by referring the original code deposited by Ge et al. in GitHub (https://github.com/nyuhuyang/scRNAseq-MouseSkinEpithelia) to reproduce the results in the original paper. The latter half was written to further examine ECM gene expression patterns in young and old epithelial sub-populations.
